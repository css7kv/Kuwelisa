                    <h4 class="service-heading">The Problem</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">The Khayelitsha Development Forum, organized by the Bandwidth Barn initiative, discovered transportation as a highly inaccessible resource to individuals of South African townships. Very few are able to afford vehicles and those who aren't do not have access to public transportation. As such, individuals are unable to leave the township to fulfill needs such as hospital care, food, and more.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">The Solution</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Crowdsourcing is a very common solution to problems in the developed world, but it has yet to make an impact in Cape Town. Kuwelisa aims to bring ride sharing to the townships of South Africa in order to meet the needs of such individuals.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">How It Works</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">Users are given the option of creating trips as drivers or signing up for existing trips as passengers. This app enables individuals with cars to split gas money, make friends, and contribute to the community. On the other hand, it allows those without vehicles to connect with resources existing within the township.</p>
